		Hi!
		My name is Wojtek — I’m a security enthusiast with a growth mindset and a passion for exploiting vulnerabilities (ethically, of course).

		Day to day, I work with international clients, hacking their applications to make them more secure.

		When I’m not buried in code or breaking things (on purpose), you’ll probably find me training BJJ, playing guitar, or getting lost in a good book.

		This blog is where I’ll be sharing my experiences, lessons learned, and the ongoing journey of becoming the best security professional I can be.
